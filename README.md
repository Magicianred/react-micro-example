# React Micro Frontends example

Example of micro frontends infrastructure for React applications.

Currently, several companies around the world are using micro frontends as an alternative to scale the front-end part of the project and facilitate the division between teams, maintain or avoid problems that a monolith may have when it gets bigger.
Micro frontends is a broad concept, but it basically divides the front-end project into several parts and run all together, commoly split in routes.

## The concept of this repository

Completly different repositories, running together based on routes. This is a good approach to have different teams working on several parts of the project and separeted deploys (more scalable).
The problem is debugging this kind of application :sweat_smile:
