# Angular Micro Project Example

Example of micro services infrastructure for Angular applications

The structure was splitted between [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) packages. With this approach, we can split the project on main modules and wrapping everything that is important for it, looking for a better infrastructure and CI/CD.
